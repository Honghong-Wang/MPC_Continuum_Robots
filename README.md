[Research Paper link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9274302)

The simulation is done using Matlab.

## Install CasAdi
Go to https://web.casadi.org/get/
<br>
Select the Matlab binary from the table
<br>
Unzip the downloaded folder and notedown the path


## Run MATLAB Simulations
### Add Files to MATLAB
Copy the MATLAB files into MATLAB Drive directory

### Change CasAdi Path
Line number 6, change 'D:/Casadi' to the CasAdi path
<br>
CasAdi path is the absolute path to the unzipped CasAdi folder,

### Run Simulations
